## 🎮 THE GAME

Simple. Fast. Addictive.  
This is **Alien Invaders** — a browser game where aliens rain down and your only mission is: **don’t die**.

👽 The aliens?  
Generated with **Stable Diffusion** and some CSS filters to look nicer.

---

## 💀 YOUR MISSION

**Kill 80 aliens.**

That's it. Sounds easy?  
It's **not**.

Getting to **100** is a **myth**. You never gonna get there.

## 🧪 STACK

- ✅ HTML
- ✅ CSS
- ✅ Vanilla JavaScript
- ❌ No frameworks. No engines. Just old school webdev.

---

## 🚀 HOW TO PLAY

## 🧠 DEVELOPER STUFF
This game was built as a simple project taught by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgesantanabr/" target="_blank">Jorge Sant' Ana</a> in one of his courses.
The thing is, everyone does this same project called 'Mata-Mosquito', as an example <a href="https://github.com/Riqueli/Game-Mata-Mosquito-" target="_blank">here</a>.  
So...  
I wanted to do something diffetent  
And here it is.

## 🏆 CHALLENGE
I dare you to get more than 90 kills.  

100+ kills?
You either cheated or you're not human 👽
